  <h1>My Journey So Far</h1>
   <p>My journey into web development has been long and convoluted. I taught ESL for over 6 years, and had no interest in IT until I received the opportunity to audit Oral exams at Duo Lingo in 2020. I was fascinated with what I saw and explored different careers in IT eventually settling on Data Analytics in 2022. I experimented with SQL and R and thoroughly enjoyed learning the nuances of both languages. I interviewed for several intriguing positions, making it to the final interview several times but never landing anything. Several aspiring analysts (who were frankly much better than me) also struggled to find work. I began studying HTML in late 2022, and have been working on developing projects and my portfolio all of 2022.

   <p> This bootcamp has been interesting. While I am familiar with most of the concepts we have learned in class, instructors pointing out small nuances and sharing their industry experience has been invaluable. It is no replacement for the self-paced study I’ve been carrying out on my own, the advice from professionals is what I was missing in my attempt to become an analyst. I’m optimistic about my future, and I look forward to delving into JavaScript and Bootstrap! </p><br>
